<p>For the final project IxD, I'm going make small <a href="http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/intonarumori/">noise intoner</a> boxes with a digital interface to make a little noise orchestra.</p>

<p>In my undergrad thesis, I made an <a href="https://dianatosca.com/the-future-of-futurism">enitrely digital version of the intonarumori</a> - it was interesting, but I wanted something a little more tactile.</p>

<h2>The Noises</h2>

<p>Users will be able to play one sample in one of six categories of noises (as specified in <a href="http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf">The art of noises</a>) </p>

<h2>Technology Interface</h2>

<p>The interface for playing the sound samples will be on MaxMSP. Users will rotate through different categories of noises and play one type of sound sample at a time. They'll be able to alter different parameters of noises.</p>

<p>The MaxMSP software will interface with an Arduino. Users be able to control the sound samples through physical components connected to the Arduino.</p>

<p>I might want to use a small <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3677">dev board</a>, but we'll see!</p>

<h2>The Box</h2>

<p>I want the box to be relatively small - like a cigar box.</p>

<p>It will have several sliders/dials, one to control pitch, another for volume, and one more for speed.</p>

<p>For now, the prototype will be made of cardboard. Conceptually, I'd like the box to have a clear top so users can see the components.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The next steps are trying this out on a breadboard with the MaxMSP interface, and then gather all the sound samples I'd like to use.</p>
