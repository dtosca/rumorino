<p>After the first ideation/iteration of my noise orchestra project, I wanted to do some more in-depth research on noise, which led me down a rabbit hole that made me rethink my entire project. This project initially began with the pursuit of making a noise instrument (that would eventually lead to a noise orchestra). It was inspired by (and was really a reimagining of) the Futurist instruments created by Luigi Russolo, the *intonarumori* (noise intoners). Russolo wanted to use noise in music, as he found harmonic music to be “too limited in its variety of timbres” <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. But as I looked more into noise theory, particularly queer theories and noise, I started to question the Futurist’s as inspiration for noise music. Instead of reimagining the Futurist’s ideas of noise, I want this instrument to focus on queering noise, and have users engage with noise as queer practice.</p>

<p>I first examined the definition of noise throughout disciplines. It turns out that throughout human history, noise, music, and sound were linked as, “The notion of noise originates from the perception of sound phenomena, which has been used to categorize and distinguish certain sounds from others” <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Physics, historically, made a distinction between sound, music, and noise and “relegated noise to nonmusical sounds and disharmonic oscillations” <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. It was an important distinction for my purposes, as I want to dismantle notions of music and noise and sounds being distinct from one another.</p>

<p>The Futurists, on the other hand, loved noise! But they certainly did not know how to use noise queerly. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti’s Futurist manifesto lauded violence and destruction, having a deep hostility for the past, academia, and (of course, for good measure) feminism <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. And, of course, the Futurist’s allied themselves with nationalism and fascism, as they wanted to restore the greatness of Italy <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. And as much as Russolo’s use of noise for music was revolutionary for its time, the political ideology encompassing his body of work is questionable (to say the least). As I read it, Russolo and the Futurists were using noise as a means to power - to supplant music and create a noise through machines. Even in the creation of noise categories, Russolo is attempting to make a tangibility to noise when it should be an experience - and moreover, it can be read as queer experience.</p>

<p>There is a queerness in all sound and noise. As Drew Daniel (half of the electronic music duo Matmos) points out in his essay “All Sound is Queer”:</p>

<blockquote>Sound queers the self/world boundary, all day, every day. It blurs the edges of any self that the subject-machine cares to have; even in the midst of “Hey you, here’s your House music,” there are other noises afoot, other sounds playing, other ways to become something more or less than one more obedient minority subject.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Which is why talk about gays and lesbians in music ought to productively shift towards the queerness of sound itself, as both an agent and a solvent of the political expiernece of antagonism encounters when hailing fails and the promise of gay community peters out. Sound - not music, but sound - can let us hear what is not yet locatable on the available maps of identity. Hearing the queerness of sound might help us echolocate the edges of subjection and enouncter everthing that stands outside of the hailing process.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In this quote, Daniel presents the connection between queerness and sound’s “universality,” destroying the norm and bringing a community to our experiences. As we create sound, music, and noise, it “[constitutes] a common pluriverse for its auditory recipients” <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. Through this way of thinking, music, noise, and sound are all linked together as queer.</p>

<p>Therefore, I want to redesign my project to align with the ideas of queering noise and noising queerly. Queerness and noise, as a bodily experience of the excess and erotic, should be felt. In line with this ethos, instead of imposing noise categories that users have to use, I want users to be able to record their own sounds and noises into the rumorino. Therefore, I’ll have to make the device wireless through bluetooth (in order to not be tethered to a computer). I’ll be changing the design of the box to reflect the changes of recording noise. I still want users to have some control over how the noises sound, so I’ll be keeping the loops, pitch modulation, and volume controls.</p>
